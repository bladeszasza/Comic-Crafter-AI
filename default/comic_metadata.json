Their signature look is a heavy, oversized orange hoodie, stained and textured like a spray-painted brick wall, with chaotic black and orange ink splatters across the chest and sleeves, appearing as if the paint is still wet. Worn, dark wash denim jeans are similarly distressed, showing rips and graffiti tags. Black high-top sneakers are scuffed and covered in more abstract paint drips. Black, fingerless gloves are visible under the hoodie cuffs. Their face is obscured by a sleek, stylized black half-mask, jagged at the edges, reminiscent of a torn stencil, hinting at a hidden identity. They carry a well-used skateboard, its underside a canvas of dynamic, almost aggressive orange and black graffiti art, streaks of paint suggesting motion. The entire figure is rendered in a grungy street art style, with bold, stylized lines, ink splatter effects, and a raw, urban aesthetic, as if stepping out of a vibrant, rebellious mural."

      "description": "Tag Master, a grizzled, older street artist who once ruled the city's walls and now guides Splatter. He has a lean, wiry frame, dressed in a faded, paint-splattered work jacket, its fabric textured like aged canvas, adorned with intricate, hand-drawn graffiti patches that tell stories of his past. A worn denim beanie covers his head, pulled low. His face is etched with wisdom and a mischievous grin, rendered in a stylized, almost caricatured way, with sharp, expressive lines. He wears thick, smudged painter's pants and sturdy, broken-in boots. His hands are perpetually stained with various paint colors, and he often carries a well-used spray paint can, almost an extension of his arm. His style is a blend of old-school wildstyle and new-school abstraction, reflected in his clothing and demeanor, all within the grungy street art aesthetic, with subtle ink wash shading and bold outlines."

She's a young, energetic figure with vibrant, short hair, possibly dyed in electric blues and purples, styled with sharp, angular edges like a pixelated graphic. She wears oversized, thick-rimmed glasses that reflect digital code and graffiti patterns. Her attire is a loose-fitting, deconstructed hoodie dress with glitch art patterns and QR codes integrated into the fabric, appearing as if spray-painted directly onto the material. Leggings are adorned with circuit board motifs that look like stylized tags. She often carries a custom-built, rugged tablet, its screen displaying flickering data and abstract geometric graffiti. Her appearance is sharp and modern, yet fully embraces the grungy street art style, with neon accents, ink splatter highlights, and a dynamic, almost 'cyber-graffiti' aesthetic."

      "description": "The Eraser, a chilling corporate enforcer who seeks to cleanse the city of all 'undesirable' art and culture, a direct opposite to Splatter's vibrant chaos. Their appearance is stark and unsettling: a tall, imposing figure clad in a featureless, sleek black suit, devoid of any creases or texture, appearing as a pure, deep void against the urban backdrop. Instead of a head, they have a smooth, polished chrome orb, perfectly reflecting distorted fragments of the city's graffiti, but never revealing a face. Their hands are encased in thick, black, industrial-grade gloves, appearing almost robotic. They carry a long, staff-like device that projects beams of pure white light, symbolizing erasure. The entire figure is rendered with harsh, angular lines and deep, oppressive shadows, almost like a negative space in the vibrant world, embodying a cold, minimalist, and destructive interpretation of the grungy street art style, with stark contrasts and a sense of unnatural perfection that is inherently unsettling."

      "description": "Conformity, The Eraser's loyal and unthinking enforcer, tasked with painting over all vibrant street art with monotonous gray. They are a hulking, broad-shouldered figure, draped in a heavy, almost shapeless, industrial gray jumpsuit, made from thick, rough canvas that appears to absorb all color. Their head is covered by a bulky, featureless gray helmet, reminiscent of a construction worker's, with a single, horizontal slit for vision, giving them a robotic, unfeeling gaze. Instead of hands, they have large, blocky, paint-roller attachments, constantly dripping a uniform, dull gray paint. Their boots are massive and scuffed, leaving gray tracks wherever they go. The figure is drawn with heavy, thick lines and a flat, desaturated color palette, contrasting sharply with the dynamic, colorful world of Splatter, existing as a symbol of oppressive uniformity within the grungy street art style, appearing like a crude, spray-painted silhouette come to life."
